## Intro

This app is intended to get you started using the bloc API, which is powered by a STRATO API. It demonstrates 3 main features of the bloc api.

  * Key creation and management
  * Smart contract creation
  * Smart contract invocation

####Application Structure
This app wires an angular front-end to our node tool bloc for working with smart contracts. Some knowledge of angular is helpful for understanding the app but not required.


## Part I: Key Management

Every interaction with the blockchain requires use of a public/private key pair and associated account on the blockchain. To do this you will need an instance of bloc running.

If you use Vagrant bloc will be included in the machine. If you are running this manually you will need to set bloc up yourself. For instructions on getting started with bloc please visit https://github.com/blockapps/bloc

Once bloc is installed you will need to create a bloc-server by running

```sh
bloc init
```

Name the app `myApp` and provide your name. The value for `apiURL` is whichever strato instance you are running. If you do not have a strato instance, the default value is our public test net we provide for developers. At the end of the installation build the app by
```sh
cd myApp
npm install
```

Then you will need 3 users. For this example use `thepass` as the password for each user and run the following commands

```sh
bloc genkey pizzaMaker
bloc genkey buyer
bloc genkey oracle
```

Note: In the bloc project directory you will see `app/users/` with associated username directories. These directories contain the keys associated with those users.

Finally run `bloc start` in your bloc project directory and your bloc API will be up and ready to handle requests from the angular app.

Now in your pizza app root directory and open the file `server/config/environment/shared.js`. Change the `apiEndPoint` to be the same url as used in `apiURL` but leave the `/eth/v1.2/` extension to the route. Once completed, run `grunt serve` and you should see the app running on localhost:9000.

Login with the pizzaMaker user and we can then deploy a new smart contract.


## Part II: Smart Contract Creation

Here you can see the `NEW PIZZA CONTRACT` button. Click the button, then choose 1 topping and enter an integer price (ex: 6), and press deploy contract. You should now see the details of your newly deployed  pizza contract.

Below is a code snippet showing how the contract was actually deployed

```js
var details = {
  password: "thepass",
  src:  $('#contract_source').text()
};

var req = {
  method: 'POST',
  url: appConfig.keyserver + 'users/' + localStorageService.get('user') + '/' + localStorageService.get('address') + '/contract',
  headers: {
    "content-type": "application/json"
  },
  data : JSON.stringify(details)
};
$http(req).then(response => {...
```

In this sample we are storing the contract src in the index.html file. For obvious reasons this is not secure but is more than fine for demonstration.

```js
var details = {
  password: "thepass",
  src:  $('#contract_source').text()
};
```

Once we have the contract we can POST the source to our bloc api that is running. Here you can see we are using local storage to save the username and public address for the user who is uploading the contract.

```js
var req = {
  method: 'POST',
  url: appConfig.keyserver + 'users/' + localStorageService.get('user') + '/' + localStorageService.get('address') + '/contract',
  headers: {
    "content-type": "application/json"
  },
  data : JSON.stringify(details)
};
$http(req).then(response => {...
```

Once this returns successfully we have created a new smart contract with our pizzaMaker user.

###Part III: Smart Contract Invocation

After our upload has finished successfully we then populate the newly created contract with our topping and pricing details

```js
var data = {
  "password": "thepass",
  "method": "setUpPizzaDetails",
  "args": {
    "price": $scope.pizzaContract.price,
    "topping": $scope.pizzaContract.topping
  },
  "contract": "Pizza"
};

var req = {
 method: 'POST',
 url: appConfig.keyserver + 'users/' + localStorageService.get('user')+ '/'+ localStorageService.get('address') + '/contract/Pizza/' + $scope.newContract + '/call',
 headers: {
   'Content-Type': 'application/json'
 },
 data: JSON.stringify(data)
};

$http(req).then(response => {...
```

Here we are hitting the contract method route, you can see above that we pass in the method name as a POST parameter `"method": "setUpPizzaDetails"`. Below is the `setUpPizzaDetails` method from our contract.

```js
function setUpPizzaDetails(uint price, string topping) {
  stateMessage = "Pizza details set";
  message = stateMessage;
  stateInt = 2;
  pizzaPrice = price;
  pizzaToppings = topping;
}
```

Now if you logout, and then login as `buyer` we will see the newly created contract listed. You will notice that this contract "state" is `open`. In the bloc api there is a route to check the state of the contract.

```js
$http.get(appConfig.keyserver + 'contracts/Pizza/' + contract + '/state/').then(response => {
```

Here I am reading a state integer and know whether or not someone has funded this pizza contract.

If I click on this pizza, I am taken to a detail screen for this specific smart contract. Click fund and you will be prompted to sign a transaction to fund this smart contract for the specified amount. This is achieved in the same way as calling other contract methods, however this time we will send value with this transaction.

```js
var data = {
  "password": $scope.password,
  "method": "buyerAcceptsPizzaContract",
  "args": {},
  "contract": "Pizza",
  "value": $scope.contractState.pizzaPrice
};
var req = {
 method: 'POST',
 url: appConfig.keyserver + 'users/' + localStorageService.get('user')+ '/'+ localStorageService.get('address') + '/contract/Pizza/' + $stateParams.id + '/call',
 headers: {
   'Content-Type': 'application/json'
 },
 data: JSON.stringify(data)
};

$http(req).then(response => {...
```
At this point the contract is the custodian of the funds and has not paid the `pizzaMaker` yet. To finalize the contract as the buyer we can click the "Rate Delivery" button and then click the happy button. This will send a final transaction to the smart contract indicating that we are satisfied and the pizzaMaker will be sent the funds. Below is the method in the smart contract that pays out the funds of the contract.

```js
function rateSatisfaction(bool isHappy) {
  stateInt = 5;
  if (isHappy) {
    stateMessage = "Pizza deliverd, buyer was happy";
    seller.send(this.balance);
  } else {
    stateMessage = "Pizza delivered, buyer was not happy";
    buyer.send(this.balance);
  }
}
```
